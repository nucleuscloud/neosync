## Introduction

[Neosync](https://www.neosync.dev) is an open-source, developer-first way to anonymize PII, generate synthetic data and sync environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.

Companies use Neosync to:

1. **Safely test code against production data** - Anonymize sensitive production data in order to safely use it locally for a better testing and developer experience
2. **Easily reproduce production bugs locally** - Anonymize and subset production data to get a safe, representative data set that you can use to locally reproduce production bugs quickly and efficiently
3. **High quality data for lower-level environments** - Catch bugs before they hit production when you hydrate your staging and QA environments with production-like data
4. **Solve GDPR, DPDP, FERPA, HIPAA and more** - Use anonymized and synthetic data to reduce your compliance scope and easily comply with laws like HIPAA, GDPR, and DPDP
5. **Seed development databases** - Easily seed development databases with synthetic data for unit testing, demos and more

## Features

- **Generate synthetic data** based on your schema
- **Anonymize existing production-data** for a better developer experience
- **Subset your production database** for local and CI testing using any SQL query
- **Complete async pipeline** that automatically handles job retries, failures and playback using an event-sourcing model
- **Referential integrity** for your data automatically
- **Declarative, GitOps based configs** as a step in your CI pipeline to hydrate your CI DB
- **Pre-built data transformers** for all major data types
- **Custom data transformers** using javascript or LLMs
- **Pre-built integrations** with Postgres, Mysql, S3

## Getting started

Neosync is a fully dockerized setup which makes it easy to get up and running.

A [compose.yml](./compose.yml) file at the root contains production image refs that allow you to get up and running with just a few commands without having to build anything on your system.

Neosync uses the newer `docker compose` command, so be sure to have that installed on your machine.

To start Neosync, clone the repo into a local directory, be sure to have docker installed and running, and then run:

```sh
make compose/up
```

To stop, run:

```sh
make compose/down
```

Neosync will now be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The production compose pre-seeds with connections and jobs to get you started! Simply run the generate and sync job to watch Neosync in action!

## Kubernetes, Auth Mode and more
