# Excalidraw

This folder is where all excalidraw diagrams live.

To open, navigate to excalidraw.io and open the file.
You can cmd+save from there to update the edit/update the file locally.

The svg must be manually exported at this time, which can be done from the excalidraw UI.

Please be sure to do so as that is how the svg gets updated and persists in the documentation today.
