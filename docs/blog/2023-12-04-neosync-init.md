We're excited to be launching Neosync v0.1.0 to the world! This is the first entry in our changelog with the base version of Neosync. If you want to read more about why we're building Neosync, you can check out this [blog.](https://www.neosync.dev/blog/introducing-neosync) Below you can see a list of the main features that we are launching with:

1. Ability to create a sync job that can sync data between two connections
2. Ability to create a data gen job that can generate synthetic data from scratch and push it into a connection
3. Ability to pause, resume, start and stop a job
4. 40+ system transformers to use out of the box
5. Ability to create custom transformers
6. Postgres, Mysql and S3 connections
7. Neosync CLI to be able to sync data from remote to locally

We'll be releasing new updates every two weeks as we continue squash bugs and release new features.
