description: "use our helm chart to deploy Neosync on your Kubernetes cluster"
---

## Prerequisites

- You have an existing Kubernetes cluster
- Installed [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/) version v3.11.3 or greater
- You have [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed and connected to your kubernetes cluster

Deploying Neosync on Kubernetes is an easy way to leverage the power of Kubernetes to make Neosync fault-tolerant, scalable and highly available. In order to make the deployment process easy and streamlined, we have created a Helm chart that you can use to deploy Neosync onto your cluster.

In the Helm chart, we expose a number of configurations that allow you to configure Neosync so that it works with the way that you have Kubernetes configured.
