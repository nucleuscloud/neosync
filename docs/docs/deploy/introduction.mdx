## Overview

Neosync can be deployed in a variety of ways, and it's ultimately up to each user how they are going to determine to do so.
Neosync is deployable on bare metal, or in dockerized environments. The latter of which is what will be covered in the following sections in greater detail.

The reader will find that the Github repository is set up primarily for dockerized environments and that we do not generally run services bare metal.
The two main supported development environments are Docker Compose, and Tilt.
