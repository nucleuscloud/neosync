## Overview

The purpose of this page is to list in detail each of the environment variables that are required to launch neosync services.
There are three discrete services in Neosync, and each one has its own purpose. See the [Platform Overview](/platform) section of the docs to understand more about the makeup of Neosync.

## Backend API

These environment variables are loaded when running the `mgmt serve connect` command which starts the main API instance.

## Open Telemetry

Neosync has support for Opentelemetry Tracing and Metering.

View the compliance matrix to see what values are understood directly via the Go SDK.
Any `OTEL_` environment variables that are documented in the table(s) above are directly used by the Neosync services and drive the configuration of the OTEL SDK.
Anything not documented in those tables and is supported vai the compliance matrix should be configurable simply by setting the environment variables (ex: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`)
