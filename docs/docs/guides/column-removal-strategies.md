## Introduction

When a Neosync Job is configured for relational databases, all columns for each selected table must have a transformer mapping configured.
This page goes into detail how Neosync handles old columns that no longer exist in the source database and the different strategies that can be used to handle this.

This is a common occurrence for any company that is adding or removing columns to a database and may not update Neosync straight away.

The `continue` strategy is the default strategy as it is the most flexible. The idea is to keep Neosync running and being less brittle to configuration drift without having to constantly check in on how Neosync is doing.

## Halt Strategy

This strategy is plain and simple. During the job run, Neosync compares the configured job mappings with the source database.
For the selected tables in the job mappings, a diff is made and if a column is found in the job mappings that doesn't exist in the source database, the run is halted.

## Continue Strategy

This strategy tells Neosync to ignore any difference in job mappings from the source database.

Neosync is able to detect that columns were removed in the source, and will leave them off of the insert statement.
This may result in failures if any unmapped columns do not have a column default in the destination connection.
