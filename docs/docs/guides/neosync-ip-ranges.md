Neosync Cloud needs to access your data sources so that it can help you configure jobs as well as synchronize data.

If you need help configuring a Bastion Host, check out the [Connect Postgres via Bastion Host](/guides/connect-private-postgres-via-bastion-host) guide.

Generally, it's good practice to limit inbound connections into a private network.

The following IP addresses are for Neosync Cloud's `us-west-2` region in AWS.
