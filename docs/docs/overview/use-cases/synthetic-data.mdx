## Introduction

Synthetic data can be useful for testing applications and services in unsecure development and stage environments where you don't want your sensitive data to be floating around. Neosync helps teams create high-quality synthetic data from their production data that is representative of that production data using our [transformers](/platform#transformers). There are multiple ways to generate high quality synthetic data that can be useful depending on the use-case.

## Full synthetic data generation

Neosync can generate synthetic data from scratch, making it easy to test new features that don't already have generated data or when the current production data is to sensitive to work with.

## Partial synthetic data generation
