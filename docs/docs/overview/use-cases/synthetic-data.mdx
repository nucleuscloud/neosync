## Introduction

Synthetic data can be useful for testing applications and services in unsecure development and stage environments where you don't want your sensitive data to be floating around. Neosync helps teams create high-quality synthetic data from their production data that is representative of that production data using our [transformers](/platform#transformers). There are multiple ways to generate high quality synthetic data that can be useful depending on the use-case.
