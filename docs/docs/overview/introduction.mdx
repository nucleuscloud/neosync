# Welcome to the Neosync Docs

Neosync is an open-source, developer-first way to anonymize PII, generate synthetic data and sync environments for better data privacy, testing and developer experience.

## Learn about Neosync

The best way to learn Neosync is to check out our core concepts and familiarize yourself with Jobs, Runs, Connections and Transformers.

<CustomCardList
  cards={[
    {
      title: 'Jobs',
      description:
        'Jobs are async workflows that transform data and sync it between connections.',
      link: 'core-concepts#jobs',
      icon: <StackIcon />,
    },
    {
      title: 'Runs',
      description:
        'Runs are instances of a job that can be started, paused and played back.',
      link: 'core-concepts#runs',
      icon: <LayersIcon />,
    },
    {
      title: 'Connections',
      description:
        'Connections are sources of data or destinations that you sync using Jobs such as databases.',
      link: 'core-concepts#connections',
      icon: <PiPlugsLight />,
    },
    {
      title: 'Transformers',
      description:
        'Transformers are data-type specific modules that anonymize or generate data.',
      link: 'core-concepts#transformers',
      icon: <LightningBoltIcon />,
    },
  ]}
