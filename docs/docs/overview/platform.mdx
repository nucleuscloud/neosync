<DocPageHeader title="Platform Overview" />

Neosync is an open-source, test data management platform that enables teams to easily anonymize sensitive data and generate synthetic data for use in lower level environments. From a platform perspective, Neosync is an async data synchronization and replication pipeline with built-in data anonymization and synthetic data generation features.

## Core concepts

Neosync follows an event-driven architecture and has three core concepts which power the platform.

### Jobs

//insert job diagram here

Jobs are async workflows that transform data and sync it between source and destination systems. They can run on a set schedule orrun ad-hoc and can be paused at any time. Under the covers, Neosync uses [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal) as our job scheduling and execution engine and [Benthos](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos) as our data transformation engine. Temporal handles all of the execution, retries, backoffs and the coordination of tasks within a job. While Benthos handle the data sync'ing and transformation.

Jobs also have <strong>types</strong>. Today, we only have <strong>data-generation</strong> job types but in the future we will other job types such as privacy-scans and schema migrations.

Every time a job is executed it creates a <strong>run</strong>. <strong>Runs</strong> are instances of a job that have been executed. Neosync exposes a lot of useful metadata for each run which can help teams understand if a run completed successfully and if not, what exactly went wrong.

### Connections

//insert connections screenshort

Connections are integrations with upstream and/or downstream systems. Jobs use connections to move data across systems. Connections are created outside of jobs so that you can re-use connections across multiple jobs without re-creating it every time. We plan to continue to expand the number of connections we offer so that we can cover most major systems. As we mentioned above, we use Benthos for our core data sync'ing and transformation. Benthos ships with a number of pre-built [connections](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/components/inputs/about) that we will work to support. If there is a connection that you'd like to see in Neosync but we haven't developer first-class support for it yet, feel free to submit a PR!
