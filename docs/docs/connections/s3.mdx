## AWS S3 Data Connection Configuration Guide

This document outlines the steps to configure an AWS S3 data connection, which is currently only usable as a destination.

**Connection Name**: Enter a unique name for this connection that you'll easily recognize. This is just a label and does not affect the connection itself.

**Bucket**: Input the name of your S3 bucket.

**Path Prefix**: Specify the path prefix of the bucket if necessary.

**AWS Region**: Enter the AWS region where your S3 bucket is hosted.

**Custom Endpoint**: If you use a custom endpoint for the AWS API, provide it here.

**AWS Profile Name**: Enter the AWS profile name. 'default' is used if no other profile is specified.

**Access Key ID**: Your AWS access key ID for programmatic access to your bucket.

**AWS Secret Access Key**: The secret access key that corresponds to the above access key ID.

**AWS Session Token**: If you are using temporary credentials, provide the session token here.

**From EC2 Role**: Toggle this on if you are using an IAM role with an EC2 instance to access S3.

**AWS Role ARN**: Specify the role ARN if you're assuming an IAM role.

**AWS Role External ID**: If the IAM role you're assuming requires an external ID, enter it here.

Complete the form with your AWS S3 bucket details. Ensure that all credentials are entered correctly to establish a secure connection. Use the 'Submit' button to save your configuration. Remember that this connection is currently only available for use as a destination in jobs.
