## Introduction

Neosync, like many web services these days, is a full-fledged API. Check out the [architecture](../overview/platform.mdx) page for an overview of how the Neosync API fits into the picture.

All of our APIs are generated from Protobuf files. For this reason, a client can easily be generated in any of the many supported languages.
Internally, we make great use of the Go SDK as well as the TypeScript SDK.

## Generating a client

### Go

The Go SDK can be easily generated, or the SDK that is committed to the Neosync repo may be freely imported and utilized.
See the [Go SDK](./go.mdx) page for more information on how to do this.

### Other languages

We are working on publishing Neosync SDKs in a few other languages, but as the Neosync protos are public, they can be downloaded separately and used to generate a client in the chosen language using `protoc` or `buf`.
