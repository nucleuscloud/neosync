Otherwise, there is a top-level list of all environment variables spread across all commands available [here](../deploy/environment-variables.md#cli).

## Metadata

CLI metadata is appended to the outgoing gRPC context to provide tracking and metadata to the API.
This lets the API know which version the CLI is using when it invokes commands to better track CLI usage over time.

The following metadata is added to all CLI context:

- Git Version
- Git Commit
- OS Platform
