## Sync Job

In Neosync, handling circular dependencies in a Sync Job involves a few key concepts:

**Support for Circular Dependencies**: Sync jobs can handle both self-referencing circular dependencies and those spanning multiple tables.

**Nullable Columns:** For circular dependencies to work, at least one table involved in the dependency must have a column that is nullable.

**Foreign Key Dependencies and Table Constraints:** While a sync job does not modify table constraints, it synchronizes data based on foreign key dependencies.

**Data Insertion and Updating Process:** Sync jobs first performs an initial data insertion. Subsequently, it updates the columns involved in the circular dependency.

## Generate Job

In Neosync, handling circular dependencies in a Generate Job involves a few key concepts:

**Support for Circular Dependencies**: Generate jobs currently do not handle circular dependencies. If the schema has a self referencing circular dependency and that column is nullable then use the `Null` transformer.

## CLI - Sync cmd

In Neosync, handling circular dependencies in a CLI Sync cmd involves a few key concepts:

**Support for Circular Dependencies**: The CLI sync feature in Neosync is capable of managing both self-referencing circular dependencies and those involving multiple tables.
In scenarios where the source data is not from a SQL database (like AWS S3) but the destination is a SQL database, Neosync utilizes the foreign key constraints of the destination
SQL database to effectively insert data. This approach ensures data integrity and respects the relational structure of the SQL database.

**Nullable Columns:** For circular dependencies to work, at least one table involved in the dependency must have a column that is nullable.

**Foreign Key Dependencies and Table Constraints:** While a CLI sync does not modify table constraints, it synchronizes data based on foreign key dependencies.

**Data Insertion and Updating Process:** Sync jobs first performs an initial data insertion. Subsequently, it updates the columns involved in the circular dependency.
