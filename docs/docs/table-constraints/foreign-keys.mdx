Neosync utilizes foreign keys in SQL databases to ensure data integrity and maintain relationships between tables during data synchronization. However, it's important to note that transforming columns
that are foreign keys is currently not supported in Neosync. This limitation means that while Neosync can handle data synchronization involving foreign keys, it cannot alter or transform the data in
these foreign key columns during the synchronization process.
