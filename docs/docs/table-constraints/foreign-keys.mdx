Neosync utilizes foreign keys in SQL databases to ensure data integrity and maintain relationships between tables during data synchronization.
Additionally, Neosync supports primary key transformations, which is a powerful feature for maintaining data consistency when primary keys
need to be altered. When you use a primary key transformation, Neosync will also update any foreign keys connected to the primary key
to reflect the change. However, it's important to note that for this automatic updating to work, the foreign key must be set to passthrough.
This setting allows Neosync to correctly identify and update the foreign keys, ensuring that the integrity and relationships within your database
are preserved even after primary key changes.
