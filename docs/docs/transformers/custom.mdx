## Introduction

Custom Transfomers are a great way to configure a system transformer with your own presets and publish it everywhere. Custom transformers are saved at the account level and
can be used across multiple jobs, saving your time during the schema configuration process.

## Creating a Custom Transformer

In order to create a custom transformer, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Transformers** page and click on **+ New Transformer**.
2. You'll be brought to the new transformer page where you can select a base transformer. A base transformer serves as the blueprint for the custom transformer. Select the base transformer for your custom transformer.

3. Once you've selected a base transformer, you'll be prompted to give the transformer a name and description. Additionally, you can preset custom default configurations depending on the transformer.

4. Once you've filled out the form, you can click on **save** and then you will be routed to the newly created transformer.

## Using a Custom Transformer

Once you've created a custom transformer, you'll see it appear in the transformer list in Transformers main page as well as the Schema configuration page. Above, we created a custom transformer
called `custom-string-transformer`, we can now see it both places.

In the transformers table under the Custom Transformer tab.

In the Schema configuration page in the transformer select.

Now we can finsih the rest of our job configuration and the newly created custom transformer will be used in the column that it's mapped to.
