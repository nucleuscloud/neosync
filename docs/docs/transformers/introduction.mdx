## Introduction

Transformers are data-type specific modules that anonymize or generate data. Tranformers are defined in the job workflow and are applied to every piece of data in the column they are assigned. Neosync ships with a number of transformers that are already built to handle common data types such as email, addresses, ssn, strings, integers and more.

## Transformer Types

There are two types of transformers:

1. **System Transformers** : Pre-built and configured transformers that automatically come with Neosync out of the box. These cannot be deleted but they can be cloned.
2. **Custom Transformers** : System transformers that have been cloned, re-configured and renamed. These transformers can be edited and deleted.

## Transformers

You can browse our list of system transformers which come out of the box or you can see how to create you own custom transformer.
