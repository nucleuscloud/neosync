## Introduction

Transformers are data-type specific modules that anonymize or generate data. Tranformers are defined in the job workflow and are applied to every piece of data in the column they are assigned. Neosync ships with a number of transformers already built that handle common data types such as email, physical addresses, ssn, strings, integers and more. You can also create your own custom transformers using a regular expression or by writing javascript code.

## More coming soon!
