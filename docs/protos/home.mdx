## Introduction

Neosync, like many web services these days, is a full-fledged API. Check out the [architecture](/platform) page for an overview of how the Neosync API fits into the picture.

All of our APIs are generated from Protobuf files. For this reason, a client can easily be generated in any of the many supported languages.
Internally, we make great use of the Go SDK as well as the TypeScript SDK.

## Clients

### Go

The Go SDK that is committed to the Neosync repo may be freely imported and utilized.
See the [Go SDK](./go.mdx) page for more information on how to use the SDK.

All of the generated code lives [here](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync/tree/main/backend/gen/go/protos/mgmt/v1alpha1).

### TypeScript

The TypeScript SDK is published to the `npm` registry. It is generated from Neosync protos and is used by the Neosync App.
See the [TS SDK](./typescript.mdx) page for more information on how to use the SDK.

All of the generated code lives [here](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync/tree/main/frontend/packages/sdk).

### Protos

All of Neosync's protos are public and can be found [here](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync/tree/main/backend/protos).
A new SDK can be easily generated by augmenting the `buf.gen.yaml` file, or providing a separate one when running the `buf` cli to generate a different SDK for other purposes.
