## Introduction

Neosync, like many web services these days, is a full-fledged API. Check out the [architecture](/platform) page for an overview of how the Neosync API fits into the picture.

All of our APIs are generated from Protobuf files. For this reason, a client can easily be generated in any of the many supported languages.
Internally, we make great use of the Go SDK as well as the TypeScript SDK.

## Configuration

There are a few inputs that any SDK needs in order to be properly configured.

1. API URL
2. Account ID
3. API Key (required for Neosync Cloud or self-hosted authenticated environments)

### API Url

If using Neosync Cloud, the backend api url is: `https://neosync-api.svcs.neosync.dev`

The standard localhost url is: `http://localhost:8080`

### Account ID

The account ID is necessary for some requests that do not have an obvious identifier like retrieving a list of jobs, or a list of connections.
This can be found by going into the app on the `/:accountName/settings` page and found in the header.

### API Key

An access token (api key, or user jwt) must be used to access authenticated Neosync environments.
For an API Key, this can be created at `/:accountName/settings/api-keys`.

## Clients

### Go

The Go SDK that is committed to the Neosync repo may be freely imported and utilized.
See the [Go SDK](./go.md) page for more information on how to use the SDK.

All of the generated code lives [here](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync/tree/main/backend/gen/go/protos/mgmt/v1alpha1).

### TypeScript

The TypeScript SDK is published to the `npm` registry. It is generated from Neosync protos and is used by the Neosync App.
See the [TS SDK](./typescript.md) page for more information on how to use the SDK.

All of the generated code lives [here](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync/tree/main/frontend/packages/sdk).

### Protos

All of Neosync's protos are public and can be found [here](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync/tree/main/backend/protos).
A new SDK can be easily generated by augmenting the `buf.gen.yaml` file, or providing a separate one when running the `buf` cli to generate a different SDK for other purposes.
