# Introduction

Developers love flexibility. They want to be able to do things their own way and transforming data is no different. Today I'm excited to give developers that flexibility in [Neosync](https://githunb.com/nucleuscloud/neosync) with Custom Code Transformers.

# What is a Transformer?

A Transformer is a data-type specific module that transforms data in some way. Transformers can be deterministic or probablistic and can anonymize data and/or generate synthetic data. Neosync ships with 40+ transformers out of the box.

For example, a `generate_float64` transformer, can generate random float64 values. Or the `generate_email` transformer can generate realistic=looking email addressses that are privacy-safe. This was useful for some use-cases where the columns are well defined and standard. How about when a column isn't a standard column? Or a developer wants to transform the data in their own custom way? This is where Custom Code Transformers come into play.

# Creating a Custom Code Transformer

Custom Code Transformers are exactly what they sound like. Developers can write their own custom code to transform the data however they'd like. Let's take a look at an example.

Let's say that I have a `users` table that has the following columns: `id, email, first_name, last_name, age`. I can use Neosync here to sync this data from prod -> stage -> local and anonymize the sensitive data. For the `id, email, first_name, last_name` columns, I can use the standard transformers while for the `age` column, I want to write a custom transformer.

In Neosync, I can go to **Transformers** -> **New Transformer** and select **Transform Javascript**.

I can give the transformer a name and description and then start to write the custom `age` transformer. All custom transformers are written in Javascript and have access to the standard library. We've integrated with [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor), the underlying text editor of VSCode to offer to auto-complete, syntax highlighting, method definitions and more.

For this custom age transformer, we're going to anonymize our the age values, which come in as a `string` type, by bucketing them into 5 year age ranges. Here is the code:

```javascript
function anonymizeAge(age) {
  const ageGroupSize = 5; // Group ages in blocks of 5 years for example
  const startAge = Math.floor(age / ageGroupSize) * ageGroupSize;
  const endAge = startAge + ageGroupSize - 1;
  return `${startAge}-${endAge}`;
}

return anonymizeAge(value);
```

We call the `anonymizeAge` function and pass in `value` as an argument. The `value` keyword is a special keyword and what you can use to access the value being transformed. Now that we've written our code we can paste it into the **Transformer Code** input box and click the **validate** button.

The **validate** button takes the custom code and attempts to compile it. If it successfully compiles then it returns `valid`. If it is unable to compile it will return `invalid`. This is a great way to check that your code can run before saving the transformer.

Once you've validated your code, you can click **Save** to save your transformer and use it in a Job.

# Using the Custom Code Transformer

Now that we've created our Custom Code Transformer, let's go ahead and create a job so we can use it. Our first step is to go to the **Jobs** page and click on **+ New Job**.

![tj](https://assets.nucleuscloud.com/neosync/docs/customcodetransformer.png)

Let's select the **Data Sync** job and then define our job.

Next, we can select our source and destination connections. We can select as many destination connections as we'd like but for this example we're going to just select our postgres staging database.

Next, the fun stuff. Neosync will automatically pull in the schema and we can configure our schema and transformers.

![tj](https://assets.nucleuscloud.com/neosync/docs/customcodetransformer.png)

We can go through our schema and select our transformers for each column. For the `age` column, we can select our `custom-age-transformer`. Once we're ready, we can click on **Next**.

Lastly, we could configure Subset filters here. These filters allow you to flexibly filter a table or dataset. For this job, we'll just go ahead and click **Submit** to create our job. Since we configured our job to initiate a run on creation, our job will immediately trigger and after just a few seconds, we can check out staging database to see our transformed data.

# Wrapping up

We've walked through how to create a Custom Code Transformer and use in it a job to anonymize age data. This is just a taste of what you can do. With ECMAScript 5.1 custom code support, you have full flexibility to transform your data in any way you'd like.

This is just the first release and we're planning on adding more features here such as support for imports and adding types. So keep an eye out for more coming soon.

Check it and let us know what you think!
