# useQuery and useMutation Imports

- When importing `useQuery` and `useMutation`, always import from `@connectrpc/connect-query`, _not_ `@tanstack/react-query`.
  - This is because we use the connect wrapper library that coincides with our API's types for a better user experience.
  - This library uses `@tanstack/react-query` under the hood.
