# Use .EXPECT Instead of .ON Syntax when using Mocks

- Mockery has two types of mocking syntax. .On("MyFunction") and .EXPECT().MyFunction
- Always prefer to use .EXPECT() as it is more type safe
- .On is worse because you provide the function as a string and do not benefit from type safety and signature changes.
- If there are cases where .On makes more sense for reasons unknown that you are aware of, prefer that.
